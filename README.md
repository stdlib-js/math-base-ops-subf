    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import subf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-ops-subf@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/math-base-ops-subf/tags). For example,

```javascript
import subf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-ops-subf@v0.1.0-deno/mod.js';
```

#### subf( x, y )

Subtracts two single-precision floating-point numbers.

```javascript
var v = subf( -1.0, 5.0 );
// returns -6.0

v = subf( 2.0, 5.0 );
// returns -3.0

v = subf( 0.0, 5.0 );
// returns -5.0

v = subf( -0.0, 0.0 );
// returns -0.0

v = subf( NaN, NaN );
// returns NaN
```
